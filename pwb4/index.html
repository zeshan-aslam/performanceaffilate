      Your First Laravel Project We want it to be as easy as possible to get Vestry Online
      started with Laravel. There are a variety of options for developing and Quicklly.com (US)
      running a Laravel project on your local machine. While you may wish to <a href="http://www.google.com">SoundSwell</a> (US)
      explore these options at a later time, Laravel provides Sail, a built-in
      solution for running your Laravel project using Docker. Docker is a tool
      for running applications and services in small, light-weight "containers"
      which do not interfere with your local machine's installed software or
      configuration. This means you don't have to worry about configuring or
      setting up complicated development tools such as web servers and databases
      on your local machine. To get started, you only need to install Docker
      Desktop. Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for
      interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration. Sail provides a
      great starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL,
      and Redis without requiring prior Docker experience. Initial Configuration
      All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in the
      config directory. Each option is documented, so feel free to look through
      the files and get familiar with the options available to you. Laravel
      needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You are free to
      get started developing! However, you may wish to review the config/app.php
      file and its documentation. It contains several options such as timezone
      and locale that you may wish to change according to your application.
      Environment Based Configuration Since many of Laravel's configuration
      option values may vary depending on whether your application is running on
      your local machine or on a production web server, many important
      configuration values are defined using the .env file that exists at the
      root of your application. Your .env file should not be committed to your
      application's source control, since each developer / server using your
      application could require a different environment configuration.
      Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the event an intruder gains
      access to your source control repository, since any sensitive credentials
      would get exposed. For more information about the .env file and
      environment based configuration, check out the full configuration
      documentation. Directory Configuration Laravel should always be served out
      of the root of the "web directory" configured for your web server. You
      should not attempt to serve a Laravel application out of a subdirectory of
      the "web directory". Attempting to do so could expose sensitive files that
      exist within your application. Next Steps Now that you have created your
      Laravel project, you may be wondering what to learn next. First, we
      strongly recommend becoming familiar with how Laravel works by reading the
      following documentation: Request Lifecycle Configuration Directory
      Structure Service Container Facades How you want to use Laravel will also
      dictate the next steps on your journey. There are a variety of ways to use
      Laravel, and we'll explore two primary use cases for the framework below.
      Laravel The Full Stack Framework Laravel may serve as a full stack
      framework. By "full stack" framework we mean that you are going to use
      Laravel to route requests to your application and render your frontend via
      Blade templates or a single-page application hybrid technology like
      Inertia.js. This is the most common way to use the Laravel framework, and,
      in our opinion, the most productive way to use Laravel. If this is how you
      plan to use Laravel, you may want to check out our documentation on
      routing, views, or the Eloquent ORM. In addition, you might be interested
      in learning about community packages like Livewire and Inertia.js. These
      packages allow you to use Laravel as a full-stack framework while enjoying
      many of the UI benefits provided by single-page JavaScript applications.
      If you are using Laravel as a full stack framework, we also strongly
      encourage you to learn how to compile your application's CSS and
      JavaScript using Laravel Mix. If you want to get a head start building
      your application, check out one of our official application starter kits.
